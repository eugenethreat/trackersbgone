# trackersbgone
trackersbgone is a simple FireFox browser extension that removes URL parameters from links in order to prevent tracking and analytics. 

# Why?
Preventing things like this - https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-utm-parameters/ that use URL parameters to track your device, click source, etc. 

**Disclaimer**: In isolation, this extension doesn't do much -- it is very much a first attempt! Anyone who wants to improve their online privacy should look at more robust offerings. It could also break certain sites that rely on URL parameters to function. 


# Notes 
Made with simple HTML, JS, and TailwindCSS.
